    <h1>About the Project</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>The Archive</h2>
        <p>This project is a digital archive of Australia’s federal electoral landscape, spanning from the inaugural 1901 election to the present day. It serves as a visual record of how democratic boundaries have shifted, expanded, and been redefined over more than a century of political history.</p>
        <p>The goal is to provide a high-fidelity, easy-to-use mapping interface that allows users to navigate every iteration of the Australian federal map.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Data</h2>
        <p>The historical data—including electoral boundaries, division namesakes, and seat results—was primarily sourced from Wikipedia’s extensive historical records and cross-referenced with Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) archives. While Wikipedia provided the foundation, the data has been manually cleaned, audited, and restructured to ensure consistency across disparate eras of record-keeping.</p>

        <h2>The Build</h2>
        <p>The site is built as a lightweight, client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes GeoJSON data to render historical boundaries dynamically.</p>

        <p>I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands throughout Australia on which these federal divisions are drawn. I pay my respects to Elders past and present and recognise that sovereignty was never ceded. This land always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land.</p>

        <p>I also acknowledge the diversity of the community, including people of all genders, sexualities, and variations of sex characteristics. I am committed to a culture of inclusion and respect for all people who form the fabric of the divisions documented here.</p>
