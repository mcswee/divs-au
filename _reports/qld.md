  <h2>Why is this deferred?</h2>
  <p>Under the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>, a redistribution is triggered if the number of members of the House of Representatives to which a state is entitled changes.</p>
  <p>The Australian Electoral Commissioner will determine the new state entitlements in July 2026. Because Queensland's population growth is on the cusp of a change, the AEC has deferred the process to ensure the new boundaries are based on the correct seat count. Starting the process now would risk the redistribution being based on an incorrect number of divisions.</p>

The redistribution for Queensland is currently deferred pending the next entitlement determination in July 2026. This will confirm whether Queensland remains at 30 seats or increases to 31 based on the latest population data.

My public suggestion, interactive map, and full report will be published here before the formal suggestion period closes in 2026.
