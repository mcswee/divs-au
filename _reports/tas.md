            <h2>Proposed electoral divisions</h2>
            <p>My suggestion ensures all electoral divisions in Tasmania meet the numerical thresholds for actual and projected enrolment, while adhering to community of interests criteria as outlined in the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>.</p>
            <p>The numerical thresholds for this redistribution are:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Redistribution quota</dt>
                    <dd>Total electors: 413,176 divided by the number of divisions: 5 = 82,635</dd>
                <dt>Threshold for electors within each division (±10%)</dt>
                    <dd>Between 74,372 and 90,898 actual electors</dd>
                <dt>Projected electoral quota</dt>
                    <dd>Total projected electors: 422,785 divided by the number of divisions: 5 = 84,557</dd>
                <dt>Threshold for projected electors within each division (±3.5%)</dt>
                    <dd>Between 81,598 and 87,526 projected electors</dd>
