        <h3>Australian Public Service</h3>
        <p>I am a current employee of the Australian Public Service (Services Australia). This website is maintained entirely in a personal capacity and does not represent the views of my employer, Services Australia, or the Australian Government.</p>

        <p>I do not use this platform to promote or oppose any political party or candidate. Where political matters are discussed, they are addressed analytically, not advocatively, and with the neutrality required of my professional role. All electoral commentary focuses on structure, process, and publicly available data.</p>
