      <h3>Australian Public Service</h3>
      <p>I am a current employee of the Australian Public Service. This website is maintained in a personal capacity and does not represent the views of my employer, Services Australia, or the Australian Government.</p>

This site complies with the Australian Public Service Commission’s guidance on personal use of social media, as well as Services Australia’s internal social media and public commentary policies.</p>
      <p>I do not use this platform to promote or oppose any political party or candidate. Where political matters are discussed, they are addressed analytically, not advocatively, and with the neutrality required of my role. Electoral commentary focuses on structure and process.</p>
      <p>As an Australian citizen, I retain the implied constitutional freedom to communicate on political matters, including those related to government and public administration. I exercise that right carefully, lawfully, and with full regard to my professional obligations.</p>
