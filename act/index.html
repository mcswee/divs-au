            <h2>Proposed electoral divisions</h2>
            <p>My suggestion ensures all electoral divisions in the Australian Capital Territory meet the numerical thresholds for actual and projected enrolment, while adhering to community of interests criteria as outlined in the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>.</p>
            <p>The numerical thresholds for this redistribution are:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Redistribution quota</dt>
                    <dd>Total electors: 321,879 divided by the number of divisions: 3 = 107,293</dd>
                <dt>Threshold for electors within each division (±10%)</dt>
                    <dd>Between 96,564 and 118,022 actual electors </dd>
                <dt>Projected electoral quota</dt>
                    <dd>Total projected electors: 344,525 divided by the number of divisions: 3 = 114,842</dd>
                <dt>Threshold for projected electors within each division (±3.5></dt>
                    <dd>Between 110,823 and 118,861 projected electors</dd>
                <p>Of The current electoral divisions, Bean is over quota at 114,006 or +6.26%. Canberra and Fenner are within the actual enrolment threshold.</p>
