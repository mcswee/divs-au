            <h2>Political neutrality</h2> 
            <p>I have served the Australian public since 2003 under multiple governments of all political persuasions. I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of any political party or similar organisation. My participation in the redistribution process is that of a politically engaged citizen exercising a personal interest in psephology and the electoral system.</p>
            <p>I do not use this platform to promote or oppose any political party, candidate or policy. Commentary focuses strictly on structure, process, and publicly available data. As an Australian citizen, I exercise my <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-freedom-opinion-and-expression" target="_blank">implied constitutional freedom</a> to communicate on political matters lawfully and with full regard to my professional obligations.</p>
