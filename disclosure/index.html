        <h1>Professional disclosure and compliance</h1>
        <p><strong>divs.au</strong> is a personal project from Darren McSweeney. I maintain this site entirely in a private capacity. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or funded by my employer Services Australia, the Australian Government, or any Australian Government department or agency.</p>

        <h2>Australian Public Service and impartiality</h2>
        <p>I am a current employee of the Australian Public Service (Services Australia). In maintaining this site, I strictly adhere to the professional standards required of public servants, specifically regarding impartiality and the separation of private interests from official duties.</p>
        <h3>APS Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>This project is conducted in a manner that maintains the public’s confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the public service. No government time, equipment, or access to restricted or sensitive resources are used to maintain this site.</p>
        <h3>APSC Guidance:</h3>
        <p> I apply the principles of the APSC <a href="https://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-values/social-media-guidance-australian-public-service-employees-and-agencies" class="external-link">guidance on personal use of social media</a> and Services Australia's <a href="https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/social-media-policy-for-agency-staff?context=64107" class="external-link">social media policy</a> to ensure my personal expression remains professional and non-partisan.</p>

        <h2>Political neutrality</h2>
        <p>I have served the Australian public since 2003 under multiple governments of all political persuasions. I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of any political party or similar associated organisation. My participation in the redistribution process is that of a politically engaged citizen exercising a personal interest in psephology and the electoral system.</p>
        <p>I do not use this platform to promote or oppose any political party, candidate, or policy. Commentary focuses strictly on structure, methodology, and process. I advocate for community of interests representation and my advocacy for the creation, modication or abolition of any electoral division, or names of divisions, is judged solely on these critera. It in no way refelects on the member of Parliament for any division, their conduct or behaviour.</p>
           <p>As an Australian citizen, I exercise my <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-freedom-opinion-and-expression" class="external-link">implied constitutional freedom</a> to communicate on political matters lawfully and with full regard to my professional obligations.</p>

I do not represent or speak on behalf of the agency, nor do I provide recommendations, strategies, or advice for conducting business with them. I do not disclose information available within my professional role, and I will not respond to queries regarding agency information or policies.</p>
