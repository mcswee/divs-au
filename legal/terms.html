    <h2>Accuracy and reconstruction</h2>
    <p>While every effort is made to ensure that the interactive maps and data accurately reflect historical records, the process of reconstructing archival boundaries onto modern digital frameworks is complex. Maps for earlier eras may be rendered over modern satellite or road geography that did not exist at the time. Discrepancies may occur where historical boundaries relied on physical features that have since changed or where archival records are ambiguous.</p>
