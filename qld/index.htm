                <h1>Queensland redistribution 2026</h1>
                    <p>The redistribution process for Queensland is currently paused pending the outcome of the next entitlement determination in July 2026. This will decide whether Queensland remains at 30 seats or increases to 31 seats, based on recent population data.</p>
                    <p>Mu public suggestion and detailed proposal, interactive map, and full report will be published here before the formal suggestion period closes in 2026.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="info-box">
                <h2>Why is this deferred?</h2>
                <p>Under the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>, a redistribution is triggered if the number of members of the House of Representatives to which a state is entitled changes.</p>
                <p>The Australian Electoral Commissioner will determine the new state entitlements in <strong>July 2026</strong>. Because Queensland's population growth is on the cusp of potentially gaining or losing a seat, the AEC has paused the process to ensure the new boundaries are based on the most accurate seat count.</p>
                <p>If the AEC started the redistribution, and then in July 2016 it was determined that Queensland should gain a division, then the stated redistribution would be compromised and based on the incorrect number of electorates.</p>
