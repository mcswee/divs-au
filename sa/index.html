        <h1>South Australia redistribution 2025</h1>
        <p>The redistribution of South Australia commenced on 12 August 2025. Public suggestions were sought from 8 October 2025 until 7 November 2025. Here you can find details of my suggestion to the Redistribution Committee.</p>

        <h2>Proposed electoral divisions</h2>
        <p>My statewide suggestion ensures all electoral divisions in South Australia meet the numerical thresholds for actual enrolment and projected enrolment, while adhering to community of interests criteria as outlined in the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>.</p>
        <p>The numerical thresholds for this redistribution are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Redistribution quota</dt>
              <dd>Total electors: 1,307,863 divided by the number of divisions: 10 = 130,786</dd>
            <dt>Threshold for electors within each division (±10%)</dt>
              <dd>Between 117,708 and 143,864 actual electors</dd>
            <dt>Projected electoral quota</dt>
              <dd>Total projected electors: 1,363,333 divided by the number of divisions: 10 = 136,333</dd>
            <dt>Threshold for projected electors within each division (±3.5%)</dt>
              <dd>Between 131,562 and 141,104 projected electors</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>All existing divisions are within the actual enrolment threshold.</p>
