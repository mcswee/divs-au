Alabama,AL,Recolor,,"Vexilogically, the current red saltire on the white is a good design. But it's got that undercurrent of Confederacy. Even if it's not intentional, it's definitely present.</p><p class=""commentary"">So I keep the satire but swap the red and white. Then I add the black to the background on the hoist and fly sides.</p><p class=""commentary"">This symbolically represents the red clay of Piedmont region and the Black Belt.</p><p class=""commentary"">Also the cultural Black Belt in the hoist side signifying the importance. Finally the white saltire representing peace and unity across the whole state. "

Connecticut,CT,Redesign,,"I am totally against grapes as a symbol for Connecticut. They are not local or native, they are not used in a major industry. The grape meaning in the coat of arms is that the population has been transplanted. Hardly fitting to build the whole identity on. So the grapes are gone.</p><p class=""commentary"">My design features an acorn and oak spring referring to the Charter Oak, where the constitution was alleged to have been hidden. I do however, keep some reference to the grapes, and because I want a distinct colour for Connecticut that's not American red, white and blue, or Yale red. So I take the purple from the grapes. I toyed with the oak being brown instead of green, but opted for green in the end as a fresher look."
Delaware,DE,Redesign,,"My design replaces the state seal with a fess dancettée, a zigzag element taken from the coat of arms of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. This geometry creates a direct visual link to the state’s namesake and the West family lineage.</p><p class=""commentary"">The three peaks represent Delaware’s three counties, while the jagged silhouette references the topography of the Delaware River and the Atlantic coastline. The palette of buff and colonial blue is retained from the existing flag, but the new layout removes the text and seals to focus on heraldic ancestry and geographic form."

Illinois,IL,Redesign,," Obviously the centennial flag is the inspiration for my redesign of Illinois. But I always thought 21 separate stars are way too busy.</p><p class=""commentary"">So I replaced it with 5 stars, the four smaller blue stars each with 5 points represent the other states. Then one six-point star in the middle, representing Illinois.</p><p class=""commentary"">The five stars represent the Illinois Confederation, also the 4 regions of Illinois (Northern, Central and Southern and the Chicago urban area), with the 6 pointed star representing Chicago area as a part of the state, but not the entirety of it.</p><p class=""commentary"">We could also have it represent the Great Lakes with only one star touching the blue stripe as only Lake Michigan touching the state."

Kentucky,KY,Redesign,,"This design is a clear, modern symbol of Kentucky’s identity, blending its unique history and culture. The Blue-Green Field honors the ""Bluegrass State."" Three Gold Stars represent the three main regions of the Commonwealth, and with five points each, represent Kentucky as the 15th state admitted to the Union. Their color nods to the Goldenrod, the state flower. The Four White Bands carry two essential meanings:</p><dl><dt>The Racetrack:</dt><dd>They are the subtle visual of the parallel rails of a Thoroughbred Racetrack, celebrating the world-famous Kentucky Derby without resorting to images of a horse or horseshoe.</dd><dt>The Border State:</dt><dd>They divide the field to reflect Kentucky’s history as a Border Commonwealth. The two upper bands represent its Northern ties, while the two lower bands honor its Southern heritage, United together in the bluegrass.</dd>"
Louisiana,LA,Redesign,,"As with many Louisiana redesigns, I couldn't not go with the ""pelican-de-lys"". I drew my own version, the pelican affronty instead of the ""standard"" one with the beak carved out of one side of the centre petal.</p><p class=""commentary"">The blood drops implying the vulning.</p><p class=""commentary"">The overall shape evokes the tricolour of France. I originally designed this with purple, gold and green, but I don't know that folks in, say, Shreveport associate themselves with Mardi Gras to the extent that those in New Orleans do. So initially, I had it red-blue-red, but that was feeling kinda Mississippi vibes, so I altered it to gold-blue-gold with a white pelican. The chaned colours feel much more Louisiana."

Maryland,MD,No Change,,
Massachusetts,MA,Redesign,,"The six stripes represent Massachusetts as the sixth state to join the Union.</p><p class=""commentary"">The mayflower is the state flower, and the name carries significants within the state.</p><p class=""commentary"">Finally the colors green, blue and cranberry are the official state colors, with the cranberry being used in the fly as the most distinctive and unique colour that clearly represents this as the flag of Massachusetts."

Missouri,MO,Redesign,,"My redesign reflects a geographic layout of the state. It's inspired by the flags of St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Jefferson City.</p><p class=""commentary"">The white and blue Missouri River flows straight through the heart of the state, with three stars positioned below it to reflect the location of the major cities south of the river.</p><p class=""commentary"">Using three 8-point stars creates 24 total points to signify Missouri’s status as the 24th state.</p><p class=""commentary"">The river motif is inspired by the flags of St. Louis and Jefferson City, while the red and blue palette is drawn from Kansas City and Jefferson City. The 8-point stars mirror the design of the new 2022 flag of Springfield."

New Hampshire,NH,Redesign,,"My New Hampshire flag is probably my least favourite. There's not a lot going on.</p><p class=""commentary"">I really wanted not to use any part of the seal or the <em>Raleigh</em>. But I just cannot think of any other inspiration. I decided I wasn't using the Old Man of the mountain silhouette, because, a) it fell down, and b) it's not really a shape that translates well for a flag.</p><p class=""commentary"">In the end, I took the proposed official state colors, red, orange and yellow, and added the nine stars from the existing flags to represent the ninth state to join the Union."
New Jersey,NJ,Redesign,,
New Mexico,NM,No Change,,
New York,NY,Redesign,,"I liked the ideas I had seen of the five stripes with a white rose. But I don't feel the white rose really reflects the state. It's named after King James II/VII from when he was still Duke of York, and even he wasn't associated with the white rose of York.</p><p class=""commentary"">So instead, I switched the rose for 11 stars. They look good there, they clearly represent the 11th state. The overall design still reflects the US stars and stripes, but in it's own distinct way.</p><p class=""commentary"">The orange obviously from the New Amsterdam and Prinsenvlag. I have seen commentary about orange, blue and white applying to the more city, not the state, but there are several upstate cities and counties that use the same colors. Finally, the 5 stripes represent:</p><ul><li>Five Iroquois tribes.</li><li>Five Boroughs of the city.</li><li>Five major rivers.<ul><li>Hudson</li><li>Mohawk</li><li>Genesee</li><li>Susquehanna</li><li>Niagara</li></ul></li><li>Five distinct regions in the state.<ul><li>New York City</li><li>Long Island</li><li>Hudson Valley</li><li>Finger Lakes</li><li>Adirondacks</li></ul></li><li>Five upstate cities<ul><li>Albany</li><li>Syracuse</li><li>Rochester</li><li>Buffalo</li><li>Utica</li></ul></li></ul>"
North Carolina,NC,Redesign,,"For North Carolina, I’ve kept the overall format of the current state flag, reworked in the style of the Guilford Courthouse flag.</p><p class=""commentary"">The hoist is changed to white with two blue eight-pointed stars. The fly has twelve horizontal stripes in red and blue, representing North Carolina as the 12th state to join the Union.</p><p class=""commentary"">The two eight-pointed stars are the same as those used in the Guildford Courthouse flag. These replace the single star and written dates on the current flag, the stars now symbolising the claims of North Carolina’s revolutionary history: May 20, 1775: the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence and April 12, 1776: the Halifax Resolves."

Pennsylvania,PA,Redesign,,"My design for Pennsylvania is a horizontal tricolor derived from the state’s iconic license plate. It uses the blue, white, and gold bands of the plate as the primary framework for the flag.</p><p class=""commentary"">The central white band features three black keystones, referencing Pennsylvania’s status as the ""Keystone State"". This layout adapts the heraldic structure of William Penn’s arms by replacing the original three circles with keystones to represent the three founding counties.</p><p class=""commentary"">The combination of the Penn heraldry with the contemporary plate colors provides a design that functions as both a historical reference and a recognizable symbol of the modern state."
Rhode Island,RI,Evolution,,"More of a simple tweak than anything. The gold anchor and stars on white are difficult to see, especially from a distance. I turned the anchor blue, and outlined the stars also in blue for contrast.</p><p class=""commentary"">Because it's really unnecesary, I also removed the ""Hope"" banner. While the sentiment is nice, it's just additional clutter. The anchor and stars do a well-enough job of identifying Rhode Island as one of the original thirteen states."
South Carolina,SC,No Change,,
South Dakota,SD,Redesign,,
Tennessee,TN,Recolor,,"The existing Tennessee flag is actually great, vexilogically speaking. But orange is an important color in Tennessee, more so then just the standard ""Red White and Blue"" because it's ""America"". And, I still feel like there a bit of a sneaky Confederate reference with the fimbriations dividing the red and blue, especially combining it with stars.</p><p class=""commentary"">So, by changing the red to orange we avoid that particular reference, and get a distinct and attractive local flag."
Texas,TX,No Change,,"I'm not even going there. Texas stays exactly the same, because why wouldn't it?"
Utah,UT,Evolution,,
Vermont,VT,Historic,,
Virginia,VA,Redesign,,"I really don't care for the Virginia seal on a flag. ""It's got a boob on it!"" seems to be the only reason it's so well liked.</p><p class=""commentary"">The whole Victory defeating Tyranny thing also doesn't sit with me. Honestly, it's more about the Revolutionary War, and the Americans overthrowing the British. It could apply to any of the original thirteen states, not just Virginia. And then, apart from the American Revolution, which let's face it, wasn't Tyranny, the whole thing has no reflection of the reality of today's Virginia.</p><p class=""commentary"">So, it's gone. Instead, I've picked the Dogwood, the state flower. The 10 sides of the central star represent the 10th state. The colors red blue and white reflect the state's importance in its role as home to several key agencies of the federal government."
