Alabama,AL,Recolor,,"Vexilogically, the current red saltire on the white is a good design. But it's got that undercurrent of Confederacy. Even if it's not intentional, it's definitely present.</p><p>So I keep the satire but swap the red and white. Then I add the black to the background on the hoist and fly sides.</p><p>This symbolically represents the red clay of Piedmont region and the Black Belt.</p><p>Also the cultural Black Belt in the hoist side signifying the importance. Finally the white saltire representing peace and unity across the whole state."
Alaska,AK,No Change,,The Big Dipper and the North Star prove that simplicity wins. It captures the scale of the wilderness and the state’s northern position without needing a single word. It’s a masterclass in using empty space to create a sense of place.
Arizona,AZ,No Change,,"The copper star and the setting sun rays are aggressive, vibrant, and perfectly capture the desert heat and mining history. While I have seen others claim the star requires fimbriation, I think the copper is distinct enough, making it one of the most balanced and recognizable designs in the country."
Arkansas,AR,Evolution,,"There is a half-decent flag hidden here, but the name tag and the generic red, white, and blue palette aren't up to scratch. My redesign strips the design back to a green and white scheme to reflect the natural landscape while stepping further away from Confederate references.</p><p>Removing the name badge allows for better spacing around the four central stars. These now represent the four nations that have ruled the land: Spain, France, the USA, and the First Nations."
California,CA,Tweak,"Lots of suggestions online match mine, almost exactly. The earliest I could find was from Reddit user <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/zxxx/"" class=""external-link"">zxxx</a> some ten years ago.","California’s flag is genuinely iconic, and the text is a historical artifact in its own right. If it were a motto, I’d be inclined to keep it, but because it functions as a literal name tag, it has to go.</p.<p>The rest of the design is strong enough to stand on its own. By removing the text and slightly adjusting the proportions of the bear and the star to balance the space, it moves from a historical protest banner to a clean, timeless icon."
Colorado,CO,Tweak,"From what I can work out, Reddit user <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/GanymedeanOutlaw/"" class=""external-link"">GanymedeanOutlaw</a> seems to be the first to suggest this (online at least).","Colorado is 99.9% of the way to a perfect flag, but that final 0.1% is a design itch I have to scratch. It has always bothered me that the edge of the “C” doesn't align with the boundary of the central white band. This minor adjustment fixes the alignment, bringing a sense of geometric order to one of the country's best existing designs."
Connecticut,CT,Redesign,,"My design for Connecticut is a vertical bicolor of white and purple. The purple fly-side stripe features an eradicated oak tree while three stars feature of the white hoist.</p><p>The three purple stars reference the three original colonies of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield, in purple referencing the three vines on the state coat of arms. The oak tree represents the Charter Oak, an iconic symbol of Connecticut’s resistance to British authority. The eradicated roots of the tree continues the transplanted theme of the grape vines."
Delaware,DE,Redesign,,"My design replaces the state seal with a fess dancettée, a zigzag element taken from the coat of arms of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. This geometry creates a direct visual link to the state’s namesake and the West family lineage.</p><p>The three peaks represent Delaware’s three counties, while the jagged silhouette references the topography of the Delaware River and the Atlantic coastline. The palette of buff and colonial blue is retained from the existing flag, but the new layout removes the text and seals to focus on heraldic ancestry and geographic form."
District of Columbia,DC,No Change,,"The existing banner of arms of George Washington are iconic, geometric and work perfectly."
Florida,FL,Evolution,,"Let's strip the veiled Confederate reference. If we claim the saltire represents the Cross of Burgundy, let's use the real thing. Then replace one of, if not the, most complicated seals in history. We replace it with a combined orange-sun representing two iconic references to the state. "
Georgia,GA,Evolution,,"Georgia doesn't even try to hide the flag is essentially a state version of the Confederate Stars and Bars. My redesign steps it back from the confederacy, removing the 13 stars as there's no need for a federal symbol. I retain the golden arch from the state seal in it's current form, including all the text. This is essentially the main symbol of Georgia, and simplification makes it unrecognisable. </p><p>To further differentiate, the canton expands to the whole hoist. The fly side consists of seven alternating red and white horizontal stripes. The four red stripes signify Georgia's status as the fourth state to ratify the Constitution. The three white stripes represent the three signers of the Declaration of Independence from Georgia, while also echoing the three pillars of the state's government."
Hawaii,HI,No Change,,"The flag of Hawaii is well-regarded, historic and well-designed. Some will disparage the British Union flag being included in a US state flag, but this has a very specific and historic reason, and is not indicate a colonial connection (as Hawaii was never a British colony or territory). Therefore, we keep the existing flag with no changes."
Idaho,ID,Redesign,,"Removing the seal on a bedsheet, I use the unofficial Idaho state colours. The red star gem represents the star garnet. The two chevrons denote progress, and reflect the mountains and Snake River."
Illinois,IL,Redesign,,"Obviously the centennial flag is the inspiration for my redesign of Illinois. But I always thought 21 separate stars are way too busy.</p><p>So I replaced it with 5 stars, the four smaller blue stars each with 5 points represent the other states. Then one six-point star in the middle, representing Illinois.</p><p>The five stars represent the Illinois Confederation, also the 4 regions of Illinois (Northern, Central and Southern and the Chicago urban area), with the 6 pointed star representing Chicago area as a part of the state, but not the entirety of it.</p><p>We could also have it represent the Great Lakes with only one star touching the blue stripe as only Lake Michigan touching the state."
Indiana,IN,Tweak,"It seems <a href=""https://yourstateflagstinks.blogspot.com/2010/10/indiana-rhode-island-and-wyoming.html?m=1"" class=""external-link"">Andy Rash</a> was the first to propose this idea online. ","A good flag can stand without a name tag, so I've removed the ""Indiana"" text. The rest of the design is already strong and effective enough to be left alone."
Iowa,IA,Redesign,,"Iowa has only generic federal symbolism in their flag. Red, white and blue and an eagle could apply to any state. That's probably why they felt the need to stick the name badge on there.</p><p>So I wanted a strong departure from the generic design. The blue stripes represent the Mississippi, Missouri and Big Sioux Rivers that make up the eastern and western borders of the state. The black represents the soil and the yellow circles represent an abstract corn cob. The 29 circles in the corn represent the entry as the 29th state."
Kansas,KS,Redesign,,"The annoying thing about the flag of Kansas as a seal on a bedsheet, when the state banner is right there, distinctive and unique. I take that distinctive and iconic sunflower and place it on a blue and green bicolor, representing the sky and fields behind the sunflower."
Kentucky,KY,Redesign,,"This design is a clear, modern symbol of Kentucky’s identity, blending its unique history and culture. The Blue-Green Field honors the ""Bluegrass State."" Three Gold Stars represent the three main regions of the Commonwealth, and with five points each, represent Kentucky as the 15th state admitted to the Union. Their color nods to the Goldenrod, the state flower. The Four White Bands carry two essential meanings:</p><p>They are the subtle visual of the parallel rails of a thoroughbred racetrack, celebrating the world-famous Kentucky Derby without resorting to images of a horse or horseshoe. Secondly, they divide the field to reflect Kentucky’s history as a Border Commonwealth. The two upper bands represent its Northern ties, while the two lower bands honor its Southern heritage, United together in the bluegrass.</p>"
Louisiana,LA,Redesign,,"As with many Louisiana redesigns, I couldn't not go with the ""pelican-de-lys"". I drew my own version, the pelican affronty instead of the ""standard"" one with the beak carved out of one side of the centre petal.</p><p>The blood drops implying the vulning.</p><p>The overall shape evokes the tricolour of France. I originally designed this with purple, gold and green, but I don't know that folks in, say, Shreveport associate themselves with Mardi Gras to the extent that those in New Orleans do. So initially, I had it red-blue-red, but that was feeling kinda Mississippi vibes, so I altered it to gold-blue-gold with a white pelican. The chaned colours feel much more Louisiana."
Maine,ME,Historic,"The illustration of the current Maine from <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_State_of_Maine.svg"" class=""external-link"">Wikimedia Commons used under <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"" class=""external-link"">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2024_Design_of_the_1901_Maine_Flag.svg"" class=""external-link"">Adam Lemire's 2024 proposed design</a> taken from Wikimedia Commons, created by user Hstoops under <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en"">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal</a>.","Maine had the opportunity to use a unique and interesting flag back in 2024 when the 1901 design was proposed. Unfortunately, the people of Maine decided to keep their current boring seal on a blue bedsheet. I would not hesitate to use the newly created version by Adam Lemire."
Maryland,MD,No Change,,"While it's very busy, the colors clash something shocking, and vexillogicialy, it's far from simple, there is no universe in which Maryland doess not use this existing design."
Massachusetts,MA,Redesign,,"My design for Massachusetts features a vertical series of stripes at the hoist: green, white, cranberry, white, blue, and white. The large cranberry fly-side field is charged with a white Mayflower containing a gold five-pointed star.</p><p>The six stripes at the hoist signify Massachusetts as the 6th state to ratify the Constitution. These stripes utilize the official state colors to map the Commonwealth’s geography from west to east, with green representing the Berkshires, cranberry symbolizing the Central Highlands, and blue standing for the Atlantic coast.</p><p>The white flower is the Mayflower, the state flower, while the gold star at its center signifies the states’s role as a leader among the original colonies. This design establishes a clear geographical narrative across the entire state."
Michigan,MI,Redesign,"This similar design was first proposed online by Reddit user <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/Full_Metal_Machinist/"" class=""external-link"">Full_Metal_Machinist.</a>",My design features a wide green hoist with two large stars to represent the Upper and Lower Peninsulas. I flipped the top star so the points more closely mirror the physical orientation of the Straits of Mackinac.
Minnesota,MN,Evolution,,"Yes! Minnesota got rid of a seal on a bedsheet, and gave us an awesome flag. I love the design, what it represents and everything about the fact they managed to actually change it. However, I'd have preferred the B2 design from the contest better. It had the triband, and the green, white and sky blue just appealed more to me."
Mississippi,MS,Tweak,"The current Mississippi flag design is owned by the <a href=""https://mdah.ms.gov/msflag"" class=""external-link"">State of Mississippi</a> and can be freely used by members of the public.","Five blue and white stripes across the fly represent the Great Lakes. This layout replaces the cluttered original with a clean, geometric representation of Michigan’s most defining natural features."
Missouri,MO,Redesign,,"My redesign reflects a geographic layout of the state. It's inspired by the flags of St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Jefferson City.</p><p>The white and blue Missouri River flows straight through the heart of the state, with three stars positioned below it to reflect the location of the major cities south of the river.</p><p>Using three 8-point stars creates 24 total points to signify Missouri’s status as the 24th state.</p><p>The river motif is inspired by the flags of St. Louis and Jefferson City, while the red and blue palette is drawn from Kansas City and Jefferson City. The 8-point stars mirror the design of the new 2022 flag of Springfield."
Montana,MT,Redesign,,"Montana’s original flag plasters a large name tag across a cluttered seal. I’ve discarded that look to evoke the spirit of ""Big Sky Country"" through a palette of blue, gold, and white. Gold mountains ground the design, while white sections above them represent the snow. A central bitterroot adds a unique and distinctive element that ensures the design remains unmistakable.</p><p>The blue field captures the vastness of the Montana sky. This transition moves away from a generic label and toward a powerful visual identity."
Nebraska,NE,Redesign,,"Nebraska’s original seal ranks among the most complicated and monochrome of the ""seal on a bedsheet"" designs. I’ve replaced that clutter with twelve long, sharp golden spikes against a dark navy blue field. These spikes represent the wheat fields and the vast, open spaces of the state.</p><p>This geometric approach transforms the flag into a bold, recognizable icon of Nebraska's agricultural landscape."
Nevada,NV,Evolution,,"Nevada’s existing flag is almost good, so I have kept the core design while removing the ""Nevada"" label from the emblem. To balance the composition, I enlarged the star to fill the resulting space.</p><p>At the bottom of the flag, I added a gold, silver, and white bar. These stripes represent the state's mineral wealth and its identity as the Silver State, as well as the desert and snow as contrasting features of the state. These changes ground the design with a solid foundation that complements the traditional cobalt blue field."
New Hampshire,NH,Redesign,,"My idea for New Hampshire uses the proposed state colors of red, orange and yellow. I take inspiration from the Second New Hampshire Regiment creating a saltire and cross in red over a field split between yelow and orange. In the center, nine stars taken in the same ring as they appear in the current flag represent the ninth state to join the Union."
New Jersey,NJ,Redesign,,"My design for New Jersey is a buff-colored field charged with a light blue saltire and three stars. The color palette is drawn from the official state colors, buff and Jersey blue, originally selected by George Washington for the New Jersey Continental Line.</p><p>The saltire is a reference to the flag of Jersey, in the Channel Islands, with the red changed to blue, while the three stars signify New Jersey's status as the third state to ratify the United States Constitution.</p><p>The composition combines the state's namesake heraldry with the numerical and military history of its founding."
New Mexico,NM,No Change,,"Probably the best existing flags. Iconic, unique, represents the state. It respects indigenous history without being patronizing and uses a color palette that's not freaking Red White and Blue!"
New York,NY,Redesign,,"Instead of the cluttered state coat of arms, I’ve used eleven stars to mark New York’s place as the eleventh state to join the Union. By setting them vertically against a blue hoist, the design maintains a structural connection to the American aesthetic while remaining a distinct, state-specific banner.</p><p>The fly is defined by five stripes of orange and white, drawing from the Prinsenvlag and the Dutch foundations of the region. While these colors are often associated strictly with the city, they reflect a heritage shared by many upstate counties and cities as well. I chose the five-stripe layout to represent the various quintets that define the state’s makeup: the five original nations of the Iroquois, the five boroughs of the city, the five major river systems, the five distinct geographic regions, and the five major upstate hubs of Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and Utica. It is a design intended to bridge the gap between the coastal metropolis and the interior, unifying the state’s history with its geography."
North Carolina,NC,Redesign,,"For North Carolina, I’ve kept the overall format of the current state flag, reworked in the style of the Guilford Courthouse flag.</p><p>The hoist is changed to white with two blue eight-pointed stars. The fly has twelve horizontal stripes in red and blue, representing North Carolina as the 12th state to join the Union.</p><p>The two eight-pointed stars are the same as those used in the Guildford Courthouse flag. These replace the single star and written dates on the current flag, the stars now symbolising the claims of North Carolina’s revolutionary history: May 20, 1775: the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence and April 12, 1776: the Halifax Resolves."
North Dakota,ND,Redesign,,"North Dakota's current flag is merely generic US symbolism on a bedsheet. While the state possesses a genuine coat of arms, it remains surprisingly underutilized. I considered using a banner of arms, but the very specific shield shape is central to its significance and would be lost in a plain rectangular translation. Adding an arrowhead symbol was another option, but that would alter the arms entirely.</p><p>My solution is to feature the complete coat of arms within a triband. The chosen colors carry specific significance to North Dakota, creating a design that finally centers the state's unique heraldic identity."
Ohio,OH,Tweak,,"Ohio possesses one of the great state flags, and I have no intention of changing its iconic swallowtail burgee shape or the central Buckeye design. My only adjustment addresses the somewhat chaotic placement of the stars. While the current separation commemorates the original colonies and the states leading up to Ohio’s admission, this is a flag for Ohio, not the thirteen colonies. I have neatened the layout by arranging all the stars in a unified circle surrounding the Buckeye.</p><p>This change maintains the flag’s historic symbolism while creating a cleaner, more cohesive visual focus on the state's central emblem."
Oklahoma,OK,Historic,,"Oklahoma’s flag features a striking and unique emblem, but it is currently weighed down by the state name at the bottom. I have removed the text to let the Osage shield, peace pipe, and olive branch speak for themselves. In redrawing the flag from scratch, the central elements have been slightly simplified, resulting in a cleaner and more iconic silhouette that emphasizes the flag's powerful message of peace and unity."
Oregon,OR,Evolution,,"Oregon already possesses the foundation of an awesome, unique flag, but the design is currently undermined by a horrible seal on the front. I have turned the design around, making the beaver the primary symbol. To add further symbolism, I introduced green and gold stripes representing the beaches, the forests, and the legacy of the Oregon Trail.</p><p>This reorganization elevates Oregon's most distinct feature, to a cohesive tribute to the state’s natural beauty and history."
Pennsylvania,PA,Redesign,,"My design for Pennsylvania is a horizontal tricolor derived from the state’s iconic license plate. It uses the blue, white, and gold bands of the plate as the primary framework for the flag.</p><p>The central white band features three black keystones, referencing Pennsylvania’s status as the ""Keystone State"". This layout adapts the heraldic structure of William Penn’s arms by replacing the original three circles with keystones to represent the three founding counties.</p><p>The combination of the Penn heraldry with the contemporary plate colors provides a design that functions as both a historical reference and a recognizable symbol of the modern state."
Rhode Island,RI,Evolution,,"More of a simple tweak than anything. The gold anchor and stars on white are difficult to see, especially from a distance. I turned the anchor blue, and outlined the stars also in blue for contrast.</p><p>Because it's really unnecesary, I also removed the ""Hope"" banner. While the sentiment is nice, it's just additional clutter. The anchor and stars do a well-enough job of identifying Rhode Island as one of the original thirteen states."
South Carolina,SC,No Change,,"This is one of the few aesthetically successful flags in the country. The simple two-tone design and high-contrast silhouette make it instantly recognizable from a distance. It’s a clean, effective layout that doesn't need to be touched."
South Dakota,SD,Redesign,,"South Dakota’s sun is a strong concept, but it is currently buried under a complex seal and the state's name, which appears twice. While the older version featuring only the sun was superior, I have opted for the design proposed by Dick Termes. By removing the outlines, I’ve refined it into a bold, clean flag that truly represents South Dakota and feels long overdue."
Tennessee,TN,Recolor,,"The existing Tennessee flag is actually great, vexilogically speaking. But orange is an important color in Tennessee, more so then just the standard ""Red White and Blue"" because it's ""America"". And, I still feel like there a bit of a sneaky Confederate reference with the fimbriations dividing the red and blue, especially combining it with stars.</p><p>So, by changing the red to orange we avoid that particular reference, and get a distinct and attractive local flag."
Texas,TX,No Change,,"The Lone Star has massive brand equity and historical weight. Its layout is so simple and effective that it has become synonymous with the state’s identity. Any attempt to ""fix"" a design this ingrained in the public consciousness would be an exercise in futility."
Utah,UT,Evolution,,"Utah’s recent move away from the ""seal on a bedsheet"" design is streets ahead of its predecessor, but the result still feels a bit corporate and designed by committee. It also relies on a standard red, white, and blue palette that feels more like a nod to the national colors than a unique expression of the state.</p><p>My redesign makes it more distinctly Utah. I’ve ditched the red, white, and blue in favor of a palette of blue, black, and yellow. By removing the hexagon—since the beehive already conveys that symbolism—and simplifying the mountains, I’ve created a more organic and focused identity for the state."
Vermont,VT,Historic,,"Vermont is yet another nothing seal on a bedsheet. But the historical flag of the Vermont Republic, the Green Mountain Boys flag is the perfect alternative."
Virginia,VA,Redesign,,"While Virginia’s seal has a certain gravitas, it feels more like a monument to the American Revolution than a reflection of the state itself. The theme of ""Victory defeating Tyranny"" could apply to any of the original thirteen colonies, and the popular fascination with the seal's anatomical details isn't a strong enough reason to keep a design that lacks a unique connection to modern Virginia.</p><p>I have replaced the seal with the dogwood, the state flower, set against a blue and red bicolor field. At the center, the yellow star evokes its proximity to Washington, D.C., while lhe red, white, and blue palette reflects the state's vital role as home to key federal agencies."
Washington,WA,Redesign,,"Washington distinguishes itself from the usual ""seal on a bedsheet"" by using a green field to evoke the state’s natural beauty, but the design remains trapped in the same uninspired format. My redesign retains that essential green symbolism while replacing the seal with George Washington’s banner of arms, rendered in green instead of the traditional red. To emphasize the state’s position in the Pacific Northwest, I have rotated the entire banner 270 degrees so that the design points decisively west.</p><p>This transformation moves away from portraiture and toward a bold, heraldic flag that feels both historically grounded and geographically distinct."
West Virginia,WV,Redesign,,"West Virginia’s current flag is yet another seal on a bedsheet, though its white field and blue border carry significant meaning. Since the border represents the state’s decision to join the Union and break away from the Confederacy, I have retained that element.</p><p>However, I have replaced the central seal with seven rhododendron flowers, the state flower. With five petals each, these seven flowers numerically represent West Virginia's admission as the 35th state."
Wisconsin,WI,Redesign,,"Wisconsin’s flag is currently a standard seal on a bedsheet. However, the crest contains a badger, which is a highly appropriate and established symbol for the state. My redesign moves away from the seal while keeping the black, white, and yellow colors. By evoking the stripes of a badger through a spiked pattern, the flag becomes fitting, unique, and visually distinctive."
Wyoming,WY,Recolor,,"Wyoming has a decent flag hiding under a horribly complicated and poorly placed seal. By removing the seal, the design is almost there. However, like many others, it relies on a red, white, and blue palette simply because it’s an American state. I have swapped those out for brown and gold, colors that are actually relevant to Wyoming’s landscape and identity."
